# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Thursday, January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**

* Explored deeper into nix and `nixpkgs.nodePackages`
* Set up Kik chat wrapper for chatwithbenz

**Thoughts**

* Nix makes sense
* Kik bots are really easy to start working with, but the documentation doesn't seem to cover setting up ngrok with the bot server.

**What I learned**

* `nix-env -f '<nixpkgs>' -iA nodePackages.some_package` installs `some_package` from `nodePackages`. A list of available Node packages in Nix can be found [here](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/top-level/node-packages.json). [Source](https://github.com/svanderburg/node2nix)
* Example: adding a node package to nix [yarn PR](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/20635).
* Update nix channel with `nix-channel --update`

**Link(s) to work**

* I'm keeping `chatwithbenz` local until it actually does something.


### Day 1: Friday, January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**

Uh oh, went on a flight from Kelowna to Toronto today. It was supposed to leave in the morning but got delayed to past noon. By the time I arrive and get to my Airbnb, it was already time for bed. Hackthon tomorrow, will try harder then.


### Day 2 & 3: Saturday, January 7, 2017 and Sunday, January 8, 2017

**Progress**

* Went to [HackTheValley](https://www.hackvalley.com/), played with Amazon Echo, and made a [custom Skill](https://devpost.com/software/alexa-my-personal-therapist) for it.

**What I learned**

* How to make an Alexa Skill in Javascript using [alexa-app](https://github.com/matt-kruse/alexa-app) and serve it using [alexa-app-server](https://github.com/matt-kruse/alexa-app-server).
* Strengthened my knowledge in basic reinforcement learning through designing a language interface that correctly understands user sentiments and provides accurate, appropriate feedback.
